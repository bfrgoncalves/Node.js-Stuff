Packages Node.js:

- express.js -> module to create a web app quickly with all the files and folders needed to run it.

- nodemon -> Refresh and track changes between files and the webserver, so there is no need to close and open the app everytime there is a change. npm install -g nodemon

to listen file changes using nodemon, write nodemon <webServerLocation> : bin/www

- hogan.js -> Template para web apps.  
- -c less -> is a dynamic stylesheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Written in JavaScript.

in each app, use express and install all the dependencies.

express <NameApp> 
express -h -> see all the parameters

All the requests are tracked using routes, and by default that route is the index.js.
We can listen to get and post requests using Router() and then use router.get or router.post

Pass data to hogan files with the tags {{ nameToPass }} and then assign the variable name in the router.
